      "BlackRock’s IBIT has seen a meteoric rise, recently entering the top five ETFs by year-to-date flows. As Bloomberg senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas put it, it has gone full Pac-Man in the past month, bringing in over $7.7 billion since April 22. As a result, the fund’s assets under management (AUM) have surged to $68.7 billion.\n",
      "The latest inflows extended the streak for spot Bitcoin ETFs to seven consecutive days, totaling $3.2 billion. Year-to-date inflows for the fund now stand at $9.1 billion, while cumulative inflows since their January debut have reached a staggering $44.6 billion.\n",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are recording $110.5 million in net inflows on Thursday, their largest daily influx since February 4. This surge comes as Ethereum enjoys its most positive price action in recent months. Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH products attracted $43.7 million and $18.9 million, respectively, while Fidelity’s FETH brought in $42.2 million. Bitwise’s ETHW generated an additional $5.7 million. However, other funds, including BlackRock’s ETHA, saw no inflows.\n",
      "The positive momentum for Ethereum ETFs continues, marking a five-day streak that has accumulated $211.8 million. Year-to-date inflows now total $61.9 million, bringing the total cumulative flows for spot Ethereum ETFs to $2.7 billion.\n"
